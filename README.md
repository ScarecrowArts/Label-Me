### DON’T PAY TO ENJOY WORKING IN AE, “LABELME” IS FREE

**labelME** is an entirely FREE After Effects script that makes using labels to color code your projects and layers easier and more enjoyable. 
**We've decided to release our source code to celebrate 10,000 downloads on our [website](https://www.scarecrowarts.com/label-me)!**

Hopefully you'll find something useful that's tucked away you can reference in your own code to also make banger scripts. 
If you find any bugs as new verisons of After Effects are released, feel free to submit a pull request and we'll review your changes and update the .jsxbin download on our website.
